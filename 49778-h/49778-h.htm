<h2 class="intro"><strong>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</strong></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is now more than four years since &#8220;The Profligate&#8221;
was written, and in the interval we have seen many
conflicting influences at work upon the theatre, many
signs of progress; but in June 1887, although the
dramatic atmosphere was full of agitation and uncertainty,
and the clamorous plaints of the pessimists were
loud, the bolt of Norwegian naturalism had not yet fallen
upon our stage, Ibsen was still, as far as England was
concerned, an exotic of the library. Mr. Pinero, however,
appears to have been an unswerving optimist in the face
of spreading pessimism; he evidently felt that the air
was clearing, that the period was approaching when the
British dramatist might begin to assert his artistic
independence, and at least attempt to write plays which
should, by means of simple and reasonable dramatic
deduction, record actual experience flowing in the natural
irregular rhythm of life, which should at the same time
embody lofty ideals of conduct and of character. So he
wrote &#8220;The Profligate,&#8221; wrote it as he explained, to fit no
particular theatrical company, fettered the free development
of his ideas by no exigencies of managerial
expediency.</p>

<p>As soon as the play was completed he sought the
opinion of one whose attitude towards the drama has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
always been marked by keen artistic sympathy and
generous devotion&mdash;that delightful comedian, that masterly
manager, John Hare. Mr. Hare&#8217;s opinion of &#8220;The
Profligate&#8221; found expression in very practical form. He
was at that time on the eve of becoming theatrically
homeless, but explaining to the author his plans for the
future, he begged Mr. Pinero to keep his play for him
until such time as he should be in a position to produce
it, a request to which Mr. Pinero gladly acceded.</p>

<p>Two years elapsed, during which period the battle of
the <em>isms</em> had proceeded apace, realism clashing with conventionalism,
naturalism with romanticism. And the
time now seemed ripe to gauge the practical progress of
the modern dramatic movement, as we may call it, to
test how far theatrical audiences were really prepared to
accept serious drama without &#8220;comic relief.&#8221; The
opportunity was at hand, the new Garrick Theatre was
completed, and Mr. John Hare produced &#8220;The Profligate.&#8221;</p>

<p>It must be admitted, however, that in doing this a
question of managerial policy prompted a concession to
popular taste or custom which Mr. Pinero had never
anticipated in the composition of &#8220;The Profligate.&#8221; He
had ended his play with the suicide of the penitent
profligate at the very moment that the wife is coming to
him with pity and forgiveness in her heart, resolved to
share his life again, to bear with him the burden of his
past as well as his future&mdash;a grimly ironical trick of
fate which the author considered to be the legitimate and
logical conclusion of this domestic tragedy.</p>

<p>But authors propose, and the &#8220;gods&#8221; dispose. Mr.
Hare, as he frankly admitted in a letter to the papers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
felt somewhat timorous of braving the popular prejudice
in favour of theatrical happiness in the last act of new
plays, and he suggested to Mr. Pinero that, as a matter
of expediency, it would be well to alter his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&#233;nouement</i>,
so as to bring about a reconciliation between the reformed
profligate and his innocent wife. Mr. Pinero fell in with
the managerial views, determining at the same time
that, while he allowed the hero of his story to live on
with promise of future happiness upon the stage,
when the play came to be printed the terrible finality
of the tragedy should be restored exactly as it was first
written.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, that it has become feasible to place
&#8220;The Profligate&#8221; in the hands of the reader, the author&#8217;s
intention is adhered to, and the play appears in its
original form. As a matter of record, however, and for
the benefit of those readers who may possibly be interested
in comparing the two versions, I think it advisable to append
below that portion of the acted text which differs from
the play as it is now published, especially since the
matter has excited some critical discussion.</p>

<p>The Fourth Act, as generally performed, is entitled
&#8220;On the Threshold,&#8221; and the departure from the original
occurs on p. 122, when Dunstan Renshaw is about to
drink the poison. From that point it runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan.</span></p>

<p>[<i>He is raising the glass to his lips when he recoils with a cry of
horror.</i>] Ah! stop, stop! This is the deepest sin of all my life&mdash;blacker
than that sin for which I suffer! No, I&#8217;ll not! I&#8217;ll not!
[<i>He dashes the glass to the ground.</i>] God, take my wretched life when
You will, but till You lay Your hand upon me, I will live on!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Help me! Give me strength to live on! Help me! Oh, help
me!</p>

<p class="hang">[<i>He falls on his knees, and buries his face in his hands.</i>
<span class="smcap">Leslie</span> <i>enters softly, carrying a lamp which she places
on the sideboard; she then goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Dunstan</span>.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Dunstan! Dunstan!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking wildly at her.</i>] You! You!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>I have remembered. When we stood together at our prayerless
marriage, my heart made promises my lips were not allowed to
utter. I will not part from you, Dunstan.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan.</span></p>

<p>Not&mdash;part&mdash;from me?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan.</span></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand you. You&mdash;will&mdash;not&mdash;relent? You cannot
forget what I am!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>No. But the burden of the sin you have committed I will bear
upon my shoulders, and the little good that is in me shall enter into
your heart. We will start life anew&mdash;always seeking for the best
that we can do, always trying to repair the worst that we have done.
[<i>Stretching out her hand to him.</i>] Dunstan! [<i>He approaches her as
in a dream.</i>] Don&#8217;t fear me! I will be your wife, not your judge.
Let us from this moment begin the new life you spoke of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan.</span></p>

<p>[<i>He tremblingly touches her hand as she bursts into tears.</i>] Wife!
Ah, God bless you! God bless you, and forgive me!</p>

<p class="hang">[<i>He kneels at her side, she bows her head down to his.</i></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my husband!</p></div>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>This ending found many advocates, even Mr. Clement
Scott and Mr. William Archer, who may be regarded as
representing the opposite poles of dramatic criticism,
agreeing in their decision that this was the only logical
conclusion. &#8220;There can be but one end to such a play,&#8221;
wrote Mr. Scott, &#8220;and Mr. Pinero has chosen the right
one. To make this wretched man whose sin has found
him out a wanderer and an outcast is bad enough; to
make him a suicide would be worse.&#8221; Yet there were
others who thought differently.</p>

<p>Wednesday, the 24th of April, 1889, saw the opening
of the Garrick Theatre and the production of &#8220;The
Profligate,&#8221; the programme of which occasion is here

<p>Probably few who were present on this occasion will
need to be reminded of the impression made upon the
audience by the new play, or of the plaudits with which
it was greeted. The success that attended the initial representation
was echoed for the most part in the chorus of
criticism. On all sides the new play was greeted with warm
words of welcome, even when these words were qualified by
serious critical strictures; the pessimists regarded it at least
as an oasis in the desert of our modern drama, while the
optimists hailed it as the herald of a bright new era of
English dramatic literature. The various voices of
criticism were, in fact, unanimous for once in regarding
this as an artistic event of quite unusual importance, even
while they were raised to question certain psychological
and ethical elements of the play in relation to actual
human experience.</p>

<p>It does not come within my province here to discuss
the several points of controversy, the various critical
objections urged against the play, but merely to recall
them as a matter of theatrical history. So be it remembered
that the central motive of the story was condemned
as being fantastically strained, for the simple reason
that at this end of the nineteenth century the mental condition
of Leslie Brudenell was inconceivable, the position
therefore being untenable from the point of view of real
life. It was further urged that any right-minded young
wife would have submissively accepted the situation in the
true wisdom of modern cynicism, or that Dunstan
Renshaw would have turned round upon her and with
brutal frankness revealed to her that her disillusioning
was only the common experience of all wives, and that
she must bow to the inevitable and make no fuss. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
laid down as law moreover that, as a leopard cannot change
its spots, so can no man who has once lived evilly be
influenced to a better, a purer life; that profligate once,
profligate he must remain for evermore. Then Hugh
Murray, the serious-minded, lofty-natured lawyer, who
can never restrain his tongue when he sees wrong-doing,
but can be nobly, piteously silent when he must bury his
love deep down in his lonely life until it nearly breaks
the heart of him&mdash;he was found by certain critics to be
impossibly unreal and even comic. It was discovered,
too, that the office of Messrs. Cheal and Murray was in
Furnival&#8217;s Inn, Fairyland&mdash;that such proceedings as
were witnessed in that office could never have been
possible in Holborn.</p>

<p>Those who made all these discoveries charged &#8220;The
Profligate&#8221; on this score or that with being untrue to
nature or false to art. Yet Mr. Pinero, in essaying to
deal dramatically with a moral problem in a manner
which, while neither cynical nor commonplace, should
still be in touch with human sympathy and possible experience,
appears to have deliberately set himself to conceive
a group of characters, natural yet not ordinary, which
should embody his ideals, and with a sufficient sense of
actuality evolve the tragic recoil of sin, the dramatic pathos
of innocence in contact with the irony of life, the exquisite
influence of purity. Whether Mr. Pinero succeeded in
carrying out his idea or not, even the severest of his
critics could not deny this play respectful consideration.
&#8220;A real play at last,&#8221; cried one; &#8220;a faulty play with one
faultless act,&#8221; was another&#8217;s summing-up after his first
enthusiasm had cooled in the refrigerator of time; while
yet a third recorded that &#8220;no original English play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
produced on our stage for many a day has stirred its
audience so deeply at the time of its representation, or
has sent them home with so much to think over, to
discuss and to remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Profligate&#8221; was performed eighty-six consecutive
times at the Garrick Theatre with considerable
success, and, as I believe some impression to the contrary
prevails, I may be pardoned for adding, with
results very satisfactory to Mr. Hare&#8217;s treasury. The
season coming to an end on July 27, the Garrick
closed, and Mr. Hare took &#8220;The Profligate&#8221; on a brief
provincial tour. At the Prince of Wales&#8217;s Theatre,
Birmingham, on September 2, it was received with
extraordinary enthusiasm, the local critics poured forth
eulogy upon eulogy, and for the next five nights the house
was crammed. From Birmingham the play went to
Manchester, where it was produced at the Theatre Royal,
on September 9, and performed there nine times. But
the Manchester critics, though respectful in their attitude,
were sparing in their praise. They complained that
Mr. Pinero was neither Dumas nor Augior, compared
him with Georges Ohnet, and found fault with his metaphors.
And the playgoers of Cottonopolis were depressed,
and bestowed such scant favour upon the play that
Mr. Hare determined to occupy the last three nights of
his engagement with a mirthful adaptation of &#8220;Les
Surprises du Divorce,&#8221; and the Manchester folk then
attended the theatre in their numbers, and laughed, and
were happy again.</p>

<p>A triumph, however, was in store for &#8220;The Profligate&#8221;
at Liverpool. On September 23, and during the rest of the
week, it was given at the Shakespeare Theatre, and press<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
and public alike greeted Mr. Pinero&#8217;s play with acclaim.
Then Mr. Hare returned to town with his company, and
reopened the Garrick with &#8220;The Profligate&#8221; on Wednesday,
October 2. Again was criticism busy with the play,
and the praise of some had cooled, and the praise of
others had warmed, but the original &#8220;run&#8221; of the play
had been interrupted in the midst of its prosperity, Mr.
Hare had resigned his part to an actor of less influence
and distinction, and after forty-five more performances it
was thought politic to withdraw the play. The notable
fact remains, however, that while theatrical audiences
were still being encouraged to expect &#8220;comic relief&#8221; and
melodramatic sensation, a serious English drama, which
made no concession to either, had been performed one
hundred and fifty-three times within a few months, with
profit to author and to manager.</p>

<p>But although &#8220;The Profligate&#8221; had been withdrawn
from the boards of the theatre, its influence was still
active. It commanded a hearing beyond the footlights,
even on the platform of the Literary and Scientific Institute.
Mr. Pinero was invited by the committee of the
Birkbeck Institution to read his play there, and this he
did on the evening of May 16th, 1890, with such marked
success that he has since been invited to repeat the
reading at many of the leading institutions in the
provinces.</p>

<p>But the theatrical career of &#8220;The Profligate&#8221; was to
take a wider range. The voice of the British dramatist
was to be heard in the land of the foreigner; but it spoke
in the necessarily mimetic tones of adaptation, and the
tongue was Dutch. &#8220;The Profligate,&#8221; bearing the title
of &#8220;De Losbol,&#8221; was produced in Amsterdam on November<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
30, 1889, under the personal supervision of Mr. J. T.
Grein, at the Municipal Theatre, which has since been
burnt down. Only a partial success is to be recorded,
the play having enjoyed but a brief career, as it did also
at the Hague, where the production took place at the
Royal Theatre. The Dutch critics were for the most
part patronising and lukewarm, patronising because the
play was English, lukewarm because the author had not
treated his theme after the cynical and pessimistic
methods of certain modern French writers. But one of
the most prominent critics of Holland was fain to admit,
in the <cite>Algemeen Handelsblad</cite> of Amsterdam, that
&#8220;viewed from an English standpoint, &#8216;The Profligate&#8217;
may certainly be called a remarkable drama,&#8221; and that
&#8220;it is a legitimate play with a properly worked-out plot,
although it contains a good deal of coincidence, and shows
a want of spirit in the dialogue.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Profligate&#8221; is next heard of in Germany, where
&#8220;The Magistrate&#8221; and &#8220;Sweet Lavender&#8221; already enjoyed
popularity; but there the voice of the author was almost
lost in the falsetto tones of the adapter. Dr. Oscar
Blumenthal, a well-known German <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">litt&#233;rateur</i> and the
popular director of the Lessing Theatre in Berlin, undertook
to introduce Mr. Pinero&#8217;s play to German playgoers.
But Dr. Blumenthal has won reputation as a wit and a
humorist, and any work from his pen must make his
audience laugh before everything; so he appears to have
adopted very drastic measures in preparing &#8220;The Profligate&#8221;
for the German theatre. He has in fact transformed
a serious drama of English life into a frivolous comedy
of Parisian manners; innocence is turned into intrigue,
the betrayed maiden becomes the scheming adventuress,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>
the play terminates with a laugh, and it is called &#8220;Falsche
Heilige&#8221;&mdash;which may be translated as &#8220;False Saints.&#8221;
But the result is popular success.</p>

<p>The first performance took place on Friday, February
13, of the present year, at the Stadttheater, Hamburg, and
a perfect triumph was achieved, adapter and actors were
called before the curtain no less than twenty times, and
the press unanimously belauded the &#8220;author&#8221;&mdash;Dr.
Blumenthal. Performances then followed with equal
success at Altona, Stettin, Graz, M&#252;nchen, Dresden, Hildesheim,
and L&#252;beck, and on Saturday, August 29,
1891, &#8220;Falsche Heilige&#8221; was produced in the German
capital at Dr. Blumenthal&#8217;s own Lessing Theatre. The
reception by Berlin playgoers and critics was as enthusiastic
as it had been elsewhere, and the glory of the
adapter was everywhere. And this is to spread still
further, for the play is to visit all the other important
theatrical towns of Germany.</p>

<p>This summarises so far the Continental career of &#8220;The
Profligate,&#8221; but in all probability it will penetrate much
further. As a modern instance of the vagaries of adaptation,
the following German criticism of &#8220;The Profligate&#8221;
in its Teutonic dress may be found amusing, in connection
with the English text of the play:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;The German author may be indebted to the English
original of &#8216;Falsche Heilige&#8217; for the plan of the piece,
and the material for the several acts, but in the entire
modelling, in its general character, and in all its merits,
it is the play of Blumenthal. It is insinuating and
amusing, persuading by fluent, elegant, refined diction,
and especially by the sparkling firework witticisms of
Blumenthal, which rise like rockets in every scene, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
the dramatic <em>aplomb</em> is preserved throughout the grand
scene in the third act, which did not fail to impress, as the
author intended. Blumenthal has shifted the action of
the story into the salons of aristocratic Parisian society,
and the strongly perfumed atmosphere of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bons-vivants</i>
and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">grisettes</i> of Paris, where comfort-loving
fathers and guardians compare their marriage-hunting
daughters or wards to &#8216;freckles,&#8217; which (as the German
Hugh Murray says) &#8216;scarcely got rid of, make their
reappearance.&#8217; The ornaments of the Boulevards are
the main characters of the play, but the author (Blumenthal)
nowhere disgusts a sensitive listener. He
tones down the conversation of the circle, and accentuates
its fascinating features, utilising it as a frame for
setting his brilliant coruscating jokes. He places contrastingly
by the side of the frivolous Don Juan the
sentimentally virtuous Paul Benoit, and by the side of
the cunning and false Magdalen the innocent child Jeanne
de Lunac. The piece is full of rich veins of light and
cheerful amusement.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Australian career of &#8220;The Profligate&#8221; has been
both experimental and successful. Mr. Charles Cartwright
and Miss Olga Nethersole produced the play at the
Bijou Theatre in Melbourne on Tuesday, June 9, of
the present year, and for the first time it was acted in the
original version, as now printed. The play ended with
Dunstan Renshaw&#8217;s suicide, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&#233;nouement</i> which the
Melbourne critics accepted as &#8220;more powerfully dramatic&#8221;
than the reconciliation, but the impression
produced upon the public was considered too painful,
and on the following Thursday evening the ending of the
Garrick version was substituted for the original, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
&#8220;gave greater satisfaction to the public.&#8221; Consequently,
this is how the play was presented on Tuesday, August 4,
1891, at the Garrick Theatre in Sydney, where it achieved
very considerable success, and aroused critical enthusiasm,
while it was even then urged that the substitution
of the &#8220;happy ending,&#8221; though managerially politic, was
calculated to &#8220;detract from the actual merits of the play.&#8221;</p>

<p>Oh, have you! Well, I don&#8217;t see that a man&#8217;s

<p>May I speak honestly, Lord Dangars?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Do. I admire anything of that sort. I think
your partner told me you were a Scotchman and

<p>Thank you. Then you will allow me to maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
that the man who marries a good woman
knowing that his past life is not as spotless as hers
grievously wrongs his wife and fools himself.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>As for wronging <em>her</em>, that&#8217;s an abstract question

<p>Why, my dear Mr. Murray, you&#8217;re actually putting
men on a level with ladies. Ladies, I admit,
are like nations&mdash;to be happy they should have no
histories. But don&#8217;t you know that Marriage is
the tomb of the Past, as far as a man is concerned?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>No, I don&#8217;t know it and I don&#8217;t believe it.</p>

<p>Why does the idea of Mr. Renshaw&#8217;s marriage
amuse you so much, Lord Dangars?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>My dear Mr. Murray, I am not laughing at Renshaw&#8217;s
marriage, but it tickles me confoundedly to
think that you, my Quixotic young friend, are to
assist at laying the marble slab upon dear old Dunstan&#8217;s
bachelor days&mdash;and nights.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>You mean that Mr. Renshaw is not, according to

honest-hearted woman?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Oh, come, come, Mr. Murray, let us be men of
the world. Renshaw&#8217;s a good fellow, just one of my

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>No, barely just. [<i>Speaking half to himself.</i>] I
thought the same the moment I first saw her. She
was walking in the grounds of the old school-house
at Helmstead, and I stood aside in the shade of the
beeches and watched her&mdash;I couldn&#8217;t help it. And
I remember how I stammered when I spoke to her;
because some women are like sacred pictures, you
can&#8217;t do more than whisper before them. That&#8217;s

Good morning, Murray. Was it a shock, George?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Terrible! You might have knocked me down

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Shut up, now! I&#8217;ve played that sort of game
out; so no reminiscences.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Trust me, my dear boy. Make me a friend of
your hearth and edit my recollections.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Then all you remember is that at Cambridge I
was a diligent but unlucky student.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Quite so&mdash;I recollect that perfectly.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>And that from boyhood I have suffered from a

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Done. You&#8217;ll recall the same of me when I next
have occasion to marry, won&#8217;t you?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bargain. I&mdash;[<i>Puts his hand over his eyes.</i>]

<p>What&#8217;s the matter? Are you ill?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>No. Wait a minute. There were some fellows at
my lodgings last night assisting at the launching of
the ship&mdash;I mean, saying good-bye to me. [<i>Supports

They set light to a bowlful of brandy and threw my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>

<p class="hang">[<i>He sinks on to the chair, with his head resting on

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Neither&mdash;green. Fortunate the lady was not

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Oh, Miss Brudenell doesn&#8217;t know why rooms
sometimes go round and round.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>No? Perhaps her relations are more penetrating.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Thank goodness there are no such incumbrances.
Leslie is an orphan; I&#8217;m an orphan. I&#8217;m alone

<p class="hang">[<i>He drains the remainder of the water and shivers.</i>]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Met her at a ball, of course. I really will be seen
at dances again by-and-by.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>A ball&mdash;nonsense. Her only idea of a ball is a lot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of girls sitting against a wall pulling crackers. She&#8217;s
a &#8220;little maid from school.&#8221;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Charming! But how&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>How&mdash;I&#8217;ll give you the recipe. Go down into the
country for a couple of days&#8217; fishing.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Often done it&mdash;caught fish, no girls.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Wait. The stream must run off your host&#8217;s property
through the recreation grounds of a young ladies&#8217; school.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>Times are altered&mdash;there was always a brick wall
in my day.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Brick walls still exist, but a heavy fish on your
line breaks down your notions of propriety and you
paddle along mid-stream. You soon discover some
pretty little women with their arms round each
other&#8217;s waists, and you apologise profusely.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>But you risk rheumatism.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>So Leslie thought, and that won me her sympathy.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Lord Dangars.</span></p>

<p>And sympathy is akin to love.</p>

Help deck me for the sacrifice, George. As luck
would have it, Leslie&#8217;s guardian, Mr. Cheal, was my
people&#8217;s lawyer years ago, and he knew I was a
gentleman and all that sort of thing. So Cheal got
my affairs into something like order, made me settle
everything on Leslie, and now you behold in me a
happy bridegroom with a headache fit to convert the
devil. Thanks, old man.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>Yes, but Leslie wants her London Mother as well

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Cheal.</span></p>

<p>Eh? What&#8217;s that?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>I&#8217;ll tell you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>No, no&mdash;you tell things so roughly. My London
Father is a name the school-girls gave you, Mr.
Cheal, because you are my guardian in London and
look after me. And when Mr. Murray began to
come down to Helmstead about once a month to see
that I was happy, they set about to invent some
title for him too. And as I couldn&#8217;t have two
fathers and I already had a real brother they called
Mr. Murray my London Mother, because he was so
thoughtful and tender, just as my school-fellows
told me their mothers are.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mr. Cheal.</span></p>

<p>H&#8217;m! Well, my dear, all that is very nice for
school-girls, but it is what practical people call stuff
and nonsense. I&#8217;ll go and get my hat.</p>

We asked if we could help her. Do you remember
how pretty she looked then, Les?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Well, what do you think the poor little lady
wanted? She wanted to find the cleverest man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Yes, but I <em>thought</em> of Mr. Renshaw.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>But, said I, &#8220;I know what you really need&mdash;a

<p>Oh, but take it. His face must be familiar to
hundreds of men and women in London. I know
that he belongs to some of your great clubs and
goes to the race-meetings in grand style&mdash;he has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>

hiding; he is flaunting about in broad sunlight in
your fine parks, maybe with another poor simple
girl on his arm. Find him for me! He isn&#8217;t a
murderer stealing along in the shadow of walls at
night-time&mdash;he is only a betrayer of women, and
men don&#8217;t hide for that!</p>

your house or in the open, the scent of the mildewed

forbids the risk of a Roman hotel.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Stonehay.</span></p>

<p>Leaving this delightful villa!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Yes, the Villa Colobiano is delightful. At any
rate Michael Angelo must have thought so at one
time, when, in a moment of misapplied artistic ecstacy,
he made his mark upon our wall.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, we&#8217;ve suffered dreadfully. Dunstan
didn&#8217;t know when he took the Villa that it is honourably
mentioned in Baedeker.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>The irrepressible Tourists have made our life a
martyrdom. With guide-book, green spectacles,
and sun-umbrella, they look for traces of Michael
Angelo in every corner of the house.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>If we&#8217;re dining they almost lift up the dish-covers.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>At first the servants hinted at a desire for seclusion
on the part of a newly married couple.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>That made matters worse; they wanted to see <em>us</em>
then.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>I am trying to be a woman, but I don&#8217;t get on
very quickly.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Irene.</span></p>

<p>Why try?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Because I am ashamed that my husband&#8217;s wife
should be so insignificant.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Irene.</span></p>

<p>You seem very fond of him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Fond of him! Fond is a poor weak word. If I
could realize my dearest desire I would be my husband&#8217;s
slave.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Stonehay.</span></p>

<p>All new wives who have money and many domestic
servants say that.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Ah, but I would, truly. Do you know what it is
to suffer keenly from over-kindness?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Irene.</span></p>

<p>I thought that was a malady the Faculty had
succeeded in stamping out.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>I suppose it lingers yet in some odd old-world
corners; it is within the crumbling walls of this
Villa, for instance. My husband is too devoted to
me. I fear to have a wish because I know he cannot
rest till it is gratified. If I look here, or
there, his dear eyes imitate mine; if I rise, he starts
up; if I walk on, he follows me. When he takes
my hand he holds it as if it were a flower with a
delicate bloom upon it; when he speaks to me he
lowers his voice like one whispering into some rare
shell that would break from too much sound. And
all for one who is half a school-girl and half a
woman, and so little of either.</p>

<p>Man, don&#8217;t thank me! For the sake of one poor
creature, your wife, I have been dishonest to another
poor creature, your broken plaything! For one
month I have lied for you in act and in spirit. In
the race between you and your victim I have given
the strong man a month&#8217;s start; to her a month of
suspense, to you a month of thoughtless happiness.
You have taken it, enjoyed it, steeped yourself to
the lips in it; and now, from this day, you play the
game of your life without a confederate. Our paths
divide!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Murray, a month ago I married this child. Perhaps,
then, I was really in love with her; I hardly
know, for loving had been to me like a tune a man
hums for a day and can&#8217;t recall a week afterwards.
But this I <em>do</em> know&mdash;I have grown to love her now
with my whole soul!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Contemptuously.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>I married her, as it were, in darkness; she seemed
to take me by the hand and to lead me out into the
light. Murray, the companionship of this pure woman
is a revelation of life to me! I tell you there
are times when she stands before me that I am like
a man dazzled and can scarcely look at her without
shading my eyes. But <em>you</em> know&mdash;because you read
my future&mdash;<em>you</em> know what my existence has become!
The Past has overtaken me! I am in
deadly fear! I dread the visit of a stranger, or the
sight of strange handwriting, and in my sleep I
dream that I am muttering into her ear the truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
against myself! And, oh, Murray, there is one
thing more that is the rack to me and yet a delight,
a paradise and yet a torment, a curse and yet
a blessing, my wife&mdash;God help me!&mdash;my wife
thinks me&mdash;Good!</p>

<p>Mrs. Stonehay! I can&#8217;t go back to her! Oh,

<p>No, dear, no&mdash;of course not. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Wilfrid</span>.] Why,
I haven&#8217;t written a word to Dun about our little visitor
and Mrs. Stonehay&#8217;s resentment at our sheltering

home to fight my battles for me, and left his business
unfinished. I know Dun.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Janet Preece.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Stonehay&#8217;s resentment at your giving me
shelter! Oh, why should she be so cruel to me!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Hush, dear&mdash;it is Mrs. Stonehay&#8217;s nature to be
jealous and arrogant. When she discovered that
her dependent, as she called you, was installed here
as my friend, she indignantly reproached me for enticing
you from her service.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>I never saw a woman so angry. I had the honour
of bowing her out at the front door, and she declared
she shook the dust of the Villa Colobiano

for her feet are very large.</p>

<p>That your mother is sorry.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Irene.</span></p>

<p>No&mdash;it means that she has just heard from Lord
Dangars that he is an old and intimate friend of
your husband&#8217;s, and that they chanced to come together
again two days ago in Rome.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>I am grieved to pain you, Irene, but I am sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
that my husband can&#8217;t be aware of the true character
of Lord Dangars.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Irene.</span></p>

<p>Possibly not, but my mother sees that Lord Dangars
may hear of her conduct through Mr. Renshaw,
and is therefore anxious to conciliate you without
delay.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Oh! [<i>She tears</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Stonehay&#8217;s</span> <i>letter into pieces</i>.]</p>

<p>Oh, Leslie, the meanness of my life is crushing
me! I can&#8217;t be faithful to my mother, and yet I
loathe myself for being a traitor to her. I seem to
bring a worldly taint even into your home, and yet
your home is so sweet and pure to me that I haven&#8217;t

<p>He will be back soon.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>With the worn, hopeless look upon his face which
makes my heart ache so. Do you guess why the
poor boy is out and about from morning till night?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Do I guess?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Ah, you <em>do</em> guess. You know that my brother is
searching for Janet Preece.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Something of the kind has crossed my mind.
Why does he look for her here?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>He ascertained that she left Florence before we
hurried out of that dreadful city; but she has not
returned to her home in the country, and so he
prays that the whirlpool has drawn her to London
again and that he may find her.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Does he confide in you?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>No, poor fellow&mdash;but I know, I know, I know.
Oh, it&#8217;s horrible that he can&#8217;t forget her&mdash;horrible!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Hush! you must try not to think.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>I do try&mdash;I do try. How long have my brother
and I been here? I can&#8217;t reckon.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>You left Florence ten days ago; you&#8217;ve been
sharing an old bachelor&#8217;s solitude almost a week.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Dear friend, your solitude must be far better than
such dismal company.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Better! No.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Ah, yes. I wanted Wilfrid to be with me when I
told you&mdash;but, I leave you early to-morrow.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>To-morrow!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Yes. I&#8217;ve written to my old schoolmistress at
Helmstead begging her to take me again&mdash;not to
learn; I&#8217;ve nothing more to learn! But I want to
sit amongst the girls again, to walk with them, and
to run down to the brook with my hands in theirs
as I did&mdash;only six weeks ago. Only six weeks ago.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>And Wilfrid?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Wilfrid has promised to visit me very often, as he
used to. So everything will be as it was&mdash;just as it
was.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>I knew you could not remain in this dreary hotel,
but still&mdash;why so suddenly?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Because I&#8217;ve been thinking that if <em>he</em> should try to
see me&mdash;you know whom I mean?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>If he should try to see me again it is to you he
would first come to ascertain my whereabouts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>And surely you would grant him an interview?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Not yet! I&#8217;m not cruel&mdash;I used not to be cruel&mdash;only
I&#8217;m not ready to meet him yet.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>When will you be prepared to meet him?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>How can I tell? I am like a dead woman dreaming
after death. What good would it do him to look
upon a soulless woman!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Is there no hope left for him?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Yes, a miracle&mdash;when there is hope for me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been keeping near you since you left Florence.
Days ago I found out you were here, through
watching your brother and Mr. Murray. If I&#8217;d sent
my name up to you you&#8217;d have refused to see me,
so I&#8217;ve been waiting my opportunity to steal into
the hotel while the porter was absent. Don&#8217;t turn
me away till you&#8217;ve heard me!</p>

<p>No. What do you want of me?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Janet Preece.</span></p>

<p>To tell you this. I&#8217;m going out to Australia in
company with some poor farming people from down
near home; I met them by chance here in London
and it&#8217;s settled. We sail from Plymouth the day
after to-morrow, and there&#8217;s an end o&#8217; me.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>Can I&mdash;do anything&mdash;to help you?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Janet Preece.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, no. But before I go I&#8217;ve got to ease my
mind of something that you must listen to. It&#8217;s
this. I&#8217;ve parted you from your husband. Haven&#8217;t

<p>Well, then, its only just to him that you should
know this. It&#8217;s <em>I</em> that tempted <em>him</em>, not he that led
me on; and I&#8217;ve lied to you in letting you think the
man was to blame instead of the woman. I&#8217;m worthless,
part of the rubbish of the world, and was so
before I met him, and he&#8217;s a better man than you
think for. There!</p>

few lines telling me he has returned to England and
entreating me to see him to-night.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll not meet him!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Why not? The man is suffering; I can read that
in his handwriting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>Suffering! Let him taste such suffering as he has
dealt out to others. Is my sister not suffering? Is
Janet Preece not suffering? Am I not suffering?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Wilfrid, my boy, Wilfrid; there&#8217;s something better
to do than to be revenged.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>How easy it is, Murray, for an onlooker to be
charitable!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Hush, my boy! Don&#8217;t you see that there is no
future for her except one of reconciliation with her
husband?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>Reconciliation!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Her ideal is destroyed, her illusions are gone, but
time will send Renshaw&#8217;s sins further and further
into the distance, and habit will teach her never to
look back.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>Murray, you don&#8217;t know! You argue like a lawyer
who has to patch up a mere wrangle between
husband and wife.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>You don&#8217;t know what it is to have the heart
plucked out of you and trampled upon!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Wilfrid, be silent!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>How can you, living your level, humdrum life,
gauge the penalty paid by those who love what is
worth so much and yet so little! Ah, Murray, wait
till you love and lose, as we have lost!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Wait! [<span class="smcap">Leslie</span> <i>enters unnoticed</i>.] Wait! Do you
think you can read me a lesson in despair? Come
to me when your boy&#8217;s passion has grown cold and
I&#8217;ll describe to you the agony of a man&#8217;s hungry,
hopeless, endless devotion.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>Murray!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>I love your sister! I have loved her from the
moment I first saw her in the school-garden at
Helmstead; but I loved her too reverently to disturb
the simplicity of her childhood, and I waited.
I waited! Waited for him to scorch into her cheeks
the first flame of consciousness&mdash;waited for her to
make him her idol&mdash;waited for him to break her
heart! Waited for this!</p>

<p class="hang">[<i>He sits with his face buried in his hands.</i>]
</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>Murray&mdash;forgive me. I never thought of this. If
we could have been brothers!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Sssh! It is always as it is now, Will. Women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
love men whose natures are like bright colours&mdash;the
homespun of life repels them. They delight to
hear their fate in the cadences of a musical voice,
thinking they are listening to an impromptu; it&#8217;s
too late when they learn that the melody has been
composed by Experience and scored by other
women&#8217;s tears. [<span class="smcap">Leslie</span> <i>reveals herself</i>.]</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Wilfrid Brudenell.</span></p>

<p>My sister!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Renshaw! I fear&mdash;you have heard.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>I never meant you to know; I meant to carry it
with me silently and patiently. The sorrow is mine&mdash;mine
only.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie</span>.</p>

<p>I&mdash;I can say nothing&mdash;nothing. Good-night.
We will not meet to-morrow&mdash;I shall be gone early.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Good-night.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Leslie.</span></p>

<p>I shall never cease to pray for your good fortune.
God bless you, Mr. Murray!</p>

strength to struggle back to England till now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry. What do you want of me?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Friendship. If you&#8217;re not my friend I haven&#8217;t
one in the world. Murray, you know where <em>she</em> is?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Yes&mdash;I know.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>Ah! I appeal to you. Exact any promise from

tell me! [<span class="smcap">Hugh</span> <i>is silent</i>.] Ah, you don&#8217;t know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
you&#8217;re doing. I am mad. Night and day I see
nothing but her face as it looked on me when she
sent me from her; night and day I hear nothing but
that one word &#8220;Go,&#8221; the last she spoke to me. The
word won&#8217;t let me sleep; it beats so on my brain.
Another word, a simple message, from her might
drive it out. Only tell me where she is! My wife,
Murray&mdash;my wife!</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>I would tell you of my own will. But I can&#8217;t
break faith with her.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

<p>She has not softened towards me then a little&mdash;a
little, Murray?</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Hugh Murray.</span></p>

<p>Man, you must have patience.</p>

<p class="speaker"><span class="smcap">Dunstan Renshaw.</span></p>

hundred years, and she has not softened towards me
just a little.</p>

<p>Fool! fool! Why couldn&#8217;t you have died in Florence?
Why did you drag yourself all these miles&mdash;to
end it <em>here</em>? I should have known better&mdash;I
should have known better. [<i>He takes a phial from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>

her, perhaps she&#8217;ll pity me. I shall never know it,
but perhaps she&#8217;ll pity me then. [<i>About to drink.</i>]
Supposing I am blind! Supposing there is some
chance of my regaining her. Regaining her! How dull
sleeplessness makes me! How much could I regain
of what I&#8217;ve lost! Why, <em>she knows me</em>&mdash;nothing can
ever undo that&mdash;<em>she knows me</em>. Every day would be
a dreary, hideous masquerade; every night a wakeful,
torturing retrospect. If she smiled, I should
whisper to myself&mdash;&#8220;yes, yes, that&#8217;s a very pretty
pretence, but&mdash;<em>she knows you</em>!&#8221; The slamming of
a door would shout it, the creaking of a stair would
murmur it&mdash;&#8220;<em>she knows you</em>!&#8221; And when she
thought herself alone, or while she lay in her sleep,
I should be always stealthily spying for that dreadful
look upon her face, and I should find it again
and again as I see it now&mdash;the look which cries
out so plainly&mdash;&#8220;Profligate! you taught one good
woman to believe in you, but now <em>she knows you</em>!&#8221;
No, no&mdash;no, no! [<i>He drains the contents of the tumbler.</i>]

The sky&mdash;the last time&mdash;the sky. [<i>He rests drowsily
against the piano.</i>] Tired&mdash;tired. [<i>He walks rather
unsteadily to the table.</i>] A line to Murray. [<i>Writing.</i>]
A line to Murray&mdash;telling him&mdash;poison&mdash;morphine&mdash;message&mdash;&mdash; [<i>The
pen falls from his hand
